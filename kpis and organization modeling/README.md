KPI & Organizational Modeling

This assignment explores how Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are structured across various layers of an organization. I modeled a real-world organization by identifying its objectives, inputs/outputs, success metrics, and critical departments.

###  Key Concepts

- Organizational hierarchy and functional units
- Defining KPIs for business performance tracking
- Mapping goals → inputs → processes → outputs → outcomes
- Linking measurable metrics to strategic goals

###  Tools Used

- Microsoft Word (Structured documentation)
